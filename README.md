# CrossGame

CrossGame is a simple and fun game where you have to cross out all the squares on a grid by clicking on them. The catch is that each click also toggles the state of the adjacent squares, so you have to plan your moves carefully. The game is developed using React as a part of the interview process at StackBox.
